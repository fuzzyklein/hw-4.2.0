      "\n",
      "   In this Telnet-style implementation of OLS, all curvilinear display\n",
      "   generated by the user on Levels II and III, Real and Complex, is\n",
      "   disregarded by the System and hence not returned to the user through\n",
      "   the Net.  The same is true of the display of special, user-created\n",
      "   characters.  Although special characters may be constructed and\n",
      "   stored, their display will be suppressed, both during the process of\n",
      "   construction and later when they are invoked from the Type level.\n",
      "   All other display generated by the System will be relayed to the user\n",
      "   intact, in some cases with stylistic transformation having first been\n",
      "   applied.  For example, Greek characters are displayed as lower-case\n",
      "   a-z.  All such transformations are described in detail in this\n",
      "   document.  Finally, those elements of the System (the operators which\n",
      "   edit user programs are prime examples) which assume a fixed-screen\n",
      "   display device function abnormally in a Telnet environment.  For such\n",
      "   a device, the System can \"remember\" the position on the screen of a\n",
      "   previously displayed segment of text and return to that position to,\n",
      "   for example, underscore it.  But when the \"screen\" marches forward --\n",
      "   relentlessly -- through a continuous medium, as it does with Telnet's\n",
      "   virtual teletype, that kind of strategy fails.  Hence, the\n",
      "   underscoring is not relocated, but rather appears on the current\n",
      "   line, beginning in the next available character frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "   OLS assumes, normally, that the user is equipped with the specially-\n",

      "   defined in this document, which enable a Telnet user to simulate that\n",

      "   particular person in depth.  Currently only the SAIL (SU-AI), SRI\n",
      "   (SRI-(KA/KL)), and ITS (MIT-(AI/ML/MC/DMS)) sites support this\n",
      "   protocol, but there are other systems with similar programs that\n",
      "   could easily be made servers; there is no required format and the\n",
      "   protocol consists mostly of specifying a single \"command line\".\n",

      "   Systems may differ in their interpretations of this line.  However,\n",
      "   the basic scheme is straightforward:  if the line is null (i.e. just\n",
      "   a <CRLF> is sent) then the server should return a \"default\" report\n",
      "   which lists all people using the system at that moment.  If on the\n",
      "   other hand a user name is specified (e.g. FOO<CRLF>) then the\n",
