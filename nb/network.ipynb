      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "       nmcli is a command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager and\n",
      "       reporting network status. It can be utilized as a replacement for\n",
      "       nm-applet or other graphical clients.  nmcli is used to create,\n",
      "       display, edit, delete, activate, and deactivate network connections, as\n",
      "       well as control and display network device status. See nmcli-\n",
      "       examples(7) for ready to run nmcli examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Typical uses include:\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   Scripts: Utilize NetworkManager via nmcli instead of managing\n",
      "           network connections manually.  nmcli supports a terse output format\n",
      "           which is better suited for script processing. Note that\n",
      "           NetworkManager can also execute scripts, called \"dispatcher\n",
      "           scripts\", in response to network events. See NetworkManager(8) for\n",
      "           details about these dispatcher scripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   Servers, headless machines, and terminals: nmcli can be used to\n",
      "           control NetworkManager without a GUI, including creating, editing,\n",
      "           starting and stopping network connections and viewing network\n",

      "OPTIONS\n",
      "       -a | --ask\n",
      "           When using this option nmcli will stop and ask for any missing\n",
      "           required arguments, so do not use this option for non-interactive\n",
      "           purposes like scripts. This option controls, for example, whether\n",
      "           you will be prompted for a password if it is required for\n",

      "           default value is auto.\n",
      "\n",
      "           The actual colors used are configured as described in terminal-\n",

      "           names supported by nmcli.\n",
      "\n",
      "           If the environment variable NO_COLOR is set (to any value), then\n",
      "           coloring is disabled with mode \"auto\". Explicitly enabling coloring\n",

      "\n",
      "       --complete-args\n",
      "           Instead of conducting the desired action, nmcli will list possible\n",
